    		<h1>Candidates List 5</h1>
		<h2>Installation</h2>
		<p>The program will be supplied by Tony. 
			It requires the Java Run Time Environment (JRE) to be installed on your machine</p>
		<h2>First usage</h2>
        	<p> The first time you start the program use the MPCORB button to select your local copy of MPCORB.DAT.</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Refresh: Refresh all data.</li>
			<li>(Observatory selection): Select G40 or W88.</li>
			<li>Ephemeris: The MPC Ephemeris page will be displayed for those the selected non-NEOCP objects.</li>
			<li>NEOCPs: The MPC Ephemeris page will be displayed for NEOCP/PCCP objects.</li>
			<li>+24hrs: Show data for the following night.</li>
			<li>ClearSel.: Turn off all selections.</li>
			<li>Where?: List visibility times of the selected objects at either observatory.</li>
			<li>Filter: Press this button to refresh the list after changing filter settings.</li>
			<li>MPCORB: Use this button to select the local copy of MPCORB.</li>	
		</ul>
		<h2>Filter</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Twilight: Select the twilight to apply when calculatibing earliest visibility.</li>
			<li>Maximum magnitude download: Objects in the various downloaded lists with current magnitudes fainter than this are ignored.</li>
			<li>Maximum magnitude display: Objects with a current magnitude fainter than this are not displayed.</li>
			<li>Minimum rise/set altitude: The rise and set times are established based on a horizon set at this altitude. 
				An object must appear above this horizon to appear in the list.</li>
			<li>Minimum galactic latitude: Objects with a Galactic Latitude less than this are excluded from the list.</li>
			<li>Show asteroids with uncertainty >=: Excludes objects with a lower uncertainty. Does not apply to NEOCPs.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Mission Time Filter</h2>
		<p>You can set Mission Times From -To to constrain the display of objects. Be careful to ensure the times are somewhere between sunset and sunrise.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>All of mission period: Objects are only listed if they are visible throught the From-To times.</li>
			<li>Not within 30m of Meridian: Objects must be visible and not positioned within 30 minutes of meridian crossing.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note that you can also use the From time to control the start time of the MPC Ephemeris listing.</p>
		
		
			
		
		
		
         	
       
       
		
		
		<p> I use robotic telescopes to capture images of Near Earth Asteroids and newly discovered comets. I 
			measure their positions and magnitudes, and report this information to the Minor Planet Centre (MPC). </p>  
        
        	<p> I have devloped some small software tools to help me. Some of them are also used by my friends in the Slooh.com 
			A-Team (a group of like-minded asteroid and comet chasers using the Slooh.com robotic telescopes.</p>
		
		<p> I am placing these tools on Github as a convenience to the A-Team members and in case they may be of any use to 
			anyone else.</p>
		<h2> ADES Comet </h2>
		
		<p> This takes separate positional (astrometric) and magnitude (photometric) observations and combines them 
			into single ADES observations containing both the astrometric and photometric information, 
			ready to send to the MPC. </p>
		
		<p><a href="adescomet.html">ADES COMET</a></p>
		
		<h2> ADES to Obs80 </h2>
		<p> This takes ADES data, as output from Astrometrica and converts it to the old Obs80 format </p>
		
		<p><a href="adesto80.html">ADES to Obs80</a></p>
		
		<h2> NEOCP Data extract </h2>
		<p> This downloads data from the MPC detailed records of NEOCP objects and extracts 
			the observations in obs80 format.</p>

		<p> Other tools will follow.</p>
