                    <p>This object is sometimes called Earth's Trojan. To earn this name it must remain close to Earth's L4 or L5
                    Lagrange points.</p>

                    <p>The simulation uses rotating coordinates to hold Earth in 
					a fixed direction relative to the Sun and includes 15 clones 
					spread over the uncertainty in the objects orbit.<p>It shows TK7 orbiting 
					close to L4, However, running forward a few years and it is 
					clear that the object is making its was round to L3 behind 
					the Sun.

                    <p>Long term simulations show it wandering backwards and 
					forwards between Earth and L3 but always staying on the L4 side 
					and the clones stay close together. I&#39;m not sure this can be 
					considered proper &quot;Trojan&quot; behaviour.</p>
					
				 <h3>Past orbit </h3>
                 <button type="button" onclick="init('2010TK7a.jdf')">2010 TK7 Past Orbit</button>

                    <p>This simulation was created by integrating backwards to 
					150BC and shows where the clones would have been at that 
					time. They are spread round 
					both the L4 and L5 sides of Earth&#39;s orbit, some travelling 
					clockwise and some anticlockwise. Clearly TK7 has not been a 
					true &quot;Trojan&quot; in the past. </p>
