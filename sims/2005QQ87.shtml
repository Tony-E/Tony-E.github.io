                    <p>2005 QQ84 has a &quot;tadpole&quot; orbit on 
                    the L5 side approaching to within 0.083AU of Earth and retreating to 1.23AU 
					each year. The simulation starts with a tilted view of the orbits to get a perspective of 
					the annual close approach. Use Tilt and Orbit/Trail to get alternative views.</p>

                    <p>Prior to 2008 each approach was getting closer but in 
					2008-9 its period changed from slightly less than 
					a year (catching up with Earth) to slightly more than a year 
					(getting left behind)</p>
					
				 <h3>Future orbit </h3>
                 <button type="button" onclick="init('2005_QQ87b.jdf')">QQ87 in 3100</button>

                    <p>QQ87 clones retreat from Earth and hover around L3 for a while then return to 
                    near-Earth around 2460AD. This behaviour is repeated but 
					uncertainty increases and the clones gradually get split up. A third visit to L3 sees some clones progress to 
                    the L4 side and by 3100 they they are quite widely spread.</p>
