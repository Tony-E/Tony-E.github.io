    		<h1>Astronomy Tools</h1>
        	<p> I track asteroids and comets! Keeps me out of the pub some of the time.</p>
		
		<p> I use robotic telescopes to capture images of Near Earth Asteroids and newly discovered comets. I 
			measure their positions and magnitudes, and report this information to the Minor Planet Centre (MPC). </p>  
        
        	<p> I have devloped some small software tools to help me. Some of them are also used by my friends in the Slooh.com 
			A-Team (a group of like-minded asteroid and comet chasers using the Slooh.com robotic telescopes.</p>
		
		<p> I am placing these tools on Github as a convenience to the A-Team members and in case they may be of any use to 
			anyone else.</p>
		<h2> ADES Comet </h2>
		
		<p> This takes separate positional (astrometric) and magnitude (photometric) observations and combines them 
			into single ADES observations containing both the astrometric and photometric information, 
			ready to send to the MPC. </p>
		
		<p><a href="adescomet.html">ADES COMET</a></p>
		
		<h2> ADES to Obs80 </h2>
		<p> This takes ADES data, as output from Astrometrica and converts it to the old Obs80 format </p>
		
		<p><a href="adesto80.html">ADES COMET</a></p>
			
		<p> Other tools will follow.</p>
