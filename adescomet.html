        <h1>Merge Comet astrometry and photometry for ADES report </h1>
        <p> The purpose is to construct an ADES report containing positional data obtained using a small aperture
            with photometric data obtained using a larger aperture.</p>
        
        <p> Using Astrometrica, measure the position of the nucleus using a small aperture to ensure the measured position is not 
            "dragged" by any non-symmetrical brightness of the coma and tail. Be sure not to add any "notes" so that the note code 
            ends up as blank or K (for a stacked images). </p>
        
        <p> Adjust the aperture so that it includes a suitable amount of the coma. 
		Typically this will be 2-3 FWHMs for a nuclear magnitude and as big as 
		you want for a Total magnitude. You can also select a different photometric catalog if desired.
            Measure the comet using the "Centroid" button, repeating Centroid/OK several times until the flux is at maximum. Select any non-blank "notes" code other than K.</p>
        
        <p> Copy and paste the entire contents of the resulting ADES Report file into the space below and press "Convert". The combined report will appear in the 
            lower window and will be available in your clipboard ready to paste into an empty .psv file for submission to the MPC.</p>
